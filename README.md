# Content Collection Reader/Writer for Neo4j (content-collection-rw-neo4j)

[![Circle CI](https://circleci.com/gh/Financial-Times/content-collection-rw-neo4j/tree/master.png?style=shield)](https://circleci.com/gh/Financial-Times/content-collection-rw-neo4j/tree/master)

An API for reading/writing Content Collection entities into Neo4j. Expects the json supplied by the ingester.

A content collection is a component created in Methode as story package or content package.
 
The service currently exposes two endpoits:

`http://host:port/content-collection/story-package` - for operations on story packages

`http://host:port/content-collection/content-package` - for operations on content packages
 
Functionally, the endpoints behave the same, the only difference being the labels and relations which are saved in **neo4j** by each.

## How to test

To run the full test suite of integration tests, you must have a running instance of elasticsearch. By default the application will look for the elasticsearch instance at http://localhost:9200. Otherwise you could specify a URL yourself as given by the example below:

```
export ELASTICSEARCH_TEST_URL=http://localhost:9200
```

run the command

```
docker-compose -f docker-compose-tests.yml up test-runner
```
 
All endpoints support the following operations:
 
- **GET** with an UUID will retrieve the contents and relations of the neo4j node with the given uuid. The node and relation labels are dictated by the exact handler used.
   
e.g. the response for a GET request request to `http://host:port/content-collection/story-package/a403a332-de48-11e6-86ac-f253db7791c6`
  
```
{
 		"uuid": "a403a332-de48-11e6-86ac-f253db7791c6",
 		"items": [{
 			"uuid": "d4986a58-de3b-11e6-86ac-f253db7791c6"
 		},
 		{
 			"uuid": "d9b4c4c6-dcc6-11e6-86ac-f253db7791c6"
 		},
 		{
 			"uuid": "d8509dc8-d7ec-11e6-944b-e7eb37a6aa8e"
 		},
 		{
 			"uuid": "404040aa-ce97-11e6-864f-20dcb35cede2"
 		},
 		{ 			
 		    "uuid": "834a2bc2-bd67-11e6-8b45-b8b81dd5d080"
 		}],
 		"publishReference": "tdi23377744",
 		"lastModified": "2017-01-31T15:33:21.687Z"
}
```

In case no node with the given uuid is available, a `404` status code is returned.
  
  
- **PUT** with an UUID and a json payload will create a node in neo4j and the associated relations. The node and relation labels are dictated by the exact handler used.
In case a node already exists, it will be updated.
 
e.g. a PUT request to `http://host:port/content-collection/story-package/a403a332-de48-11e6-86ac-f253db7791c6` with the following payload:

```
{
 		"uuid": "a403a332-de48-11e6-86ac-f253db7791c6",
 		"items": [{
 			"uuid": "d4986a58-de3b-11e6-86ac-f253db7791c6"
 		},
 		{
 			"uuid": "d9b4c4c6-dcc6-11e6-86ac-f253db7791c6"
 		},
 		{
 			"uuid": "d8509dc8-d7ec-11e6-944b-e7eb37a6aa8e"
 		},
 		{
 			"uuid": "404040aa-ce97-11e6-864f-20dcb35cede2"
 		},
 		{ 			
 		    "uuid": "834a2bc2-bd67-11e6-8b45-b8b81dd5d080"
 		}],
 		"publishReference": "tdi23377744",
 		"lastModified": "2017-01-31T15:33:21.687Z"
}
```
should result in a `200` status code response.

- **DELETE** with an UUID will delete the neo4j node with the given uuid alongside all its relations.

e.g. a DELETE request to `http://host:port/content-collection/story-package/a403a332-de48-11e6-86ac-f253db7791c6` 
will result in a `204` status code if the node has been deleted or in a `404` status code if there was no 
node with the given uuid.

- **GET** on the `__count` path of a handler will return the number of nodes currenly in neo4j. The labels of the nodes counted 
depend on the exact handler used.

e.g. a GET request to `http://host:port/content-collection/story-package/__count` will return 
the number of story package nodes currently in neo4j. The response is not json formatted, it is simply a number
like `10` or `0`.
